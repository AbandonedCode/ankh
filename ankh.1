.Sh NAME
.Nm ankh
.Nd file encryption utility
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm ankh
.Op Fl dv
.Op Fl m Ar mode
.Ar infile
.Ar outfile
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility will read from
.Ar infile
and write to
.Ar outfile .
Encryption is done by default unless the
.Fl d
option is used.
The
.Fl m
option controls the key derivation function.
The
.Fl v
option prints extra details about the operation being performed.
.Pp
The key derivation function uses Argon2i.
The encryption process uses the XSalsa20 stream cipher.
Authentication is done with Poly1305 MAC.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl d
Decrypt the input data.
.It Fl m Ar mode
Modes for the key derivation function.
.Bl -tag -width compact
.It Ar 1
Requires 32 Mb of dedicated RAM
.It Ar 2
Requires 128 Mb of dedicated RAM, and takes about 0.7
seconds on a 2.8 Ghz Core i7 CPU
